This tar package contains:

   * .dockerignore -- empty but crucial file for docker
   * Dockerfile    -- to build a self-contained image of OCaml with OPAM and EasyCrypt preinstalled
   * README        -- this file
   * run.sh        -- shell script to launch Docker container
   * shared/       -- empty directory for your work; this will appear as /home/opam/shared in the running Docker container

Build the Docker image by running:
  $ cd [path/to/unpacked/]cs512-easycrypt-docker
  $ docker build -t "cs512/easycrypt:latest" .
This will take a while. It's imperative that you navigate to this directory first before attempt a build to prevent sending unnecessary files to the Docker build daemon.

To launch the Docker container and open up a shell for it, use the provided shell scrypt:
   $ ./run.sh
You can also pass commands to the shell script which will in turn pass them to the Docker container:
   $ ./run.sh echo hi
   hi
Alternatively, you can issue the following command (adding, removing flags to your heart's content):
  $ docker run -it -e TERM --name "easycrypt-box" -v "$PWD/shared":/home/opam/shared --rm cs512/easycrypt
